Description: Implementation of "light" stemmers for French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Finnish, Swedish. 
  They are based on the same work as the "light" stemmers found in SolR or ElasticSearch. 
  A "light" stemmer consist in removing inflections only for noun and adjectives. 
  Indexing verbs for Italian, French or German is not of primary importance compared to nouns and adjectives. 
  The stemming procedure for French is described in (Savoy, 1999).
